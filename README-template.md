## My process
I continued using flexbox in the site for every element i can and used media-queries to make a mobile first layout as well.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first project of frontendmentor.io as well as 1st project in which i worked with flex. I learnt how to give a tint to an image and also made this website without bootstrap. there is some problem that i faced upon using flex-wrap. i hope to learn more through the community. 


### Continued development

i would continue to work and learn flexbox and its properties for a faster and more custom WebDev.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - i like its layout and its really easy to understand things through its examples.
